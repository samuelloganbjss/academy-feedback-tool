# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project uses GoLang for the backend and API. 

Ensure that your server is running for the frontend to fetch data as this uses an inmemory database that is not deployed for developing purposes at this stage.

## Available Scripts

In the src directory in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
This project is not deployed yet. 

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `go run main.go`

To start the backend server run this command from the backend directory within the project directory. 
`go run main.go`
This will run an API at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) click to view it in your browser.
